Please follow these instructions for using the **BCDevExchange-CodeChallenge** org.

## About
The **BCDevExchange-CodeChallenge** org was created to house private repositories for administering code challenges. 

These code challenges are used in the hiring process for developer positions with the B.C. government, and for the competition/evaluation process that private companies go through when competing for a [_Sprint With Us_ opportunity](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities).

## Use

If you would like to use this space to administer a code challenge, please follow this procedure:

1. Email Mark.Wilson@gov.bc.ca to request access. Mark will make you an Owner of the org so you can create and manage new private repositories.

2. Create private repositories for your code challenge as necessary. While in a repository, navigate to **Settings > Collaborators & teams** to give individuals access (add collaborators). 

3. If you find that you cannot add a collaborator because there are no more **seats** available, click on '**Buy more**':

As an Owner of the BCDevExchange-CodeChallenge org, you'll have authority to buy more seats to the org. Please only add the exact number of seats you'll need. We (the BCDevExchange) pay for each seat on a monthly basis.

4. After you've run your code challenge and the collaborators no longer need access to the repository, navigate again to **Settings > Collaborators & teams** and remove all of the collaborators from the repo.

5. Lastly, email Mark.Wilson@gov.bc.ca again and tell him you're all done and that he can remove you as an Owner. 

Thank you! ✌️
