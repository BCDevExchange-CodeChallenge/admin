Docs and instructions for using the **BCDevExchange-CodeChallenge** org

## About
The **BCDevExchange-CodeChallenge** org was created to house private repos that are used to administer code challenges. 

These code challenges are used in the hiring process for developer positions with the BC Government, and for the competition/evaluation process that private companies go through when competing for a [_Sprint With Us_ opportunity](https://www.bcdevexchange.org/opportunities).

## Requesting access

If you would like access to this org to create a private code challenge repository or to view past code challenges, please contact Mark.Wilson@gov.bc.ca. 

## Managing seats

The BCDevExchange pays a monthly fee for maintaing a small number of 'seats' in this org. Owners, Members, and Collaborators are all counted against the available seats, so we like to keep membership limited and up-to-date.

Members and Collaborators who no longer need access should be removed so as to free up seats for current and future code challenges.

## Adding seats

If you're in a situation where there are a bunch of code challenges running at once and there are no more seats to allocate, an Owner or Billing Manager of the org will need to [purchase more](https://help.github.com/en/articles/upgrading-your-github-subscription#upgrading-your-organizations-subscription).

## Removing collaborators when code challenge is done

When your code challenge has finished, please remove all Outside Collaborators from the repository. This will allow us to reduce the seats needed in the org and keep our monthly costs lower.

Thank you!
